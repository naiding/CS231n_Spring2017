# CS231n_Spring2017



This is the codes for CS231n Spring 2017. Put it here for future convenience.



#### Assignment1

Implemented four classifier for cifar10 dataset: kNN, SVM, Softmax and two layer network. Use them by simply create corresponding instance, then train and predict. 

If you don't need jupyter notebook, then there is no need to install so many libraries described in official documents. 



#### Assignment2

Assignment 2 contains specific implementation of neural networks and convolution neural networks. There are lots of useful building blocks of NN, such as all kinds of layers(dropout, batch normalization, etc), different optimizers and so on. At the same time, the design architecture of code is also worth learning.
